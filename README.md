# TCP vs Reliable UDP

This is two python programs to test the efficiency of file transfer using TCP vs reliable UDP.

## Installation

You can download the files directly from github or using git clone in terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmoore96/TCP-vs-Reliable-UDP.git
```

## Setup
1. Choose Either TCP or rUDP and enter the directory.
2. Open the serverSide and clientSide files in an IDE or text editor of your liking.
3. Change the following lines of code and enter the IP Address and port number.

TCP/Receiver/serverSide.py:
```python
#initializing host, port
HOST = '000.000.0.00' #PUT the Server IP HERE!
PORT = 10002 #Change port number to match your router settings
```
TCP/Sender/clientSide.py:
```python
#initializing host, port, filename, total time and number of times to send the file
host = '000.000.0.00' #PUT the Server IP HERE!
port = 10002 #Change port number to match your router settings
```

rUDP/Receiver/serverSide.py:
```python
#initializing host, port
serverAddress = '000.000.0.00' #PUT the Server IP HERE!
serverPort = 10002 #Change port number to match your router settings
```

rUDP/Sender/clientSide.py:
```python
#initializing host, port, filename, total time and number of times to send the file
serverAddress = '000.000.0.00' #PUT the Server IP HERE!
serverPort = 10002 #Change port number to match your router settings
```
## Usage
1. Run the gen.py script inside the Sender directory(both TCP/rUDP) to generate the files to be sent OR use your own file.
```bash
python3 gen.py
```
2. You can copy the contents of the files that were generated by gen.py to the file named send.text OR change the variable "fileName" in clientSide.py(applies to both TCP/rUDP).
```python
#Can be changed to which ever file you want to send.
fileName = "send.txt"
```
3. Once these changes have been made, ensure you save the python file.

4. Run Receiver/serverSide.py FIRST.

```bash
python3 serverSide.py
```

5. Run Sender/clientSide.py SECOND
```bash
python3 serverSide.py
```

## Output

Server Side:
```bash
Receiver % python3 serverSide.py
